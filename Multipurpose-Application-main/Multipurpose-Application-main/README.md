in our major project i.e. multipurpose application we will be using SHA-1 which contains 40 hexadecimal characters.

other hashing algorithms are:-
SHA-1 produces a hash that is always 40 hexadecimal characters long (160 bits).
SHA-256 produces a hash that is 64 hexadecimal characters long (256 bits).
SHA-512 produces a hash that is 128 hexadecimal characters long (512 bits).
